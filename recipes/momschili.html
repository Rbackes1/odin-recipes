    <h2>A perfect meal to warm your bones on a <em>chili</em> day!</h2>
    
    <p>My mom would make this recipe starting early in the fall and all throught the colder winter months,
        even a few times in the summer because it was just that good. It has a great texture, right inbetween soup
        and stew contistency, perfect meat/bean/vegetable ratio, and just the right amount to spice to get your tounge
        dancing. This recipe is always just waiting to be used in the back of my head. It's so easy you could learn to
        code while you make it!

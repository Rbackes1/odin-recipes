    <h2>A perfect meal to warm your bones on a chili day!</h2>
    <p>My mom would make this recipe early in the fall and often, even a few times in the summer because it was just that good. It has a great texture, right inbetween soup
        and stew contistency, perfect meat/bean/vegetable ratio, and just the right amount to spice to get your tounge dancing. This recipe is always just waiting to be used 
        in the back of my head. It's so easy you could learn to code while you make it!

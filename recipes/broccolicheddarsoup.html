        <p>There is nothing quite like a hot bowl of broccoli cheddar
            soup on a cold rainy day. I was first introduced to this 
            wonderful creation in middle school believe it or not! 
            That's when I fell in love with it; my growing teenage body 
            couldn't get enough of the stuff at school. It's not like
            school food is very good either, so that should give you a 
            hint as to how good this soup really is.
